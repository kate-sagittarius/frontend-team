  The size of our homes shapes so much of our lives.

  A physical home is, after all, the primary place where family members or
   flatmates interact with one another, and a space’s dimensions and layout act
    as a foundation for how our relationships develop. The ways the interior is
     utilised – things such as the division of rooms and the amount of dedicated
     open space ­– set up opportunities for and limitations on how we’ll interact
      with those around us (for better and worse).

  It may not just be the literal footprint of a space that creates our
   relationships, though. A small 2019 research report from
    Brigham Young University, in the US state of Utah, shows that the more
    positive we feel about our homes, the healthier our interactions
     in the home can be.

  Carly Thornock, an interior designer, led a research team following
  164 families with young children in the western US who came from a wide
   spectrum of home types and income levels – some with fewer than 100 sq ft
    of space per person.
  Over two years, they observed how their physical environments related
   to four basic elements of family functioning: affective responsiveness,
    emotional expression, acceptance and decision making. The children and
     parents
     also took surveys about their family functioning at home, and were
     asked to rate their level of agreement with statements like “I feel
     crowded in my house” or “family members feel accepted for what they are”.
      Researchers then contextualised these answers with variables including
      the families’ house sizes, income, number of rooms and family members
      in the home.
  The researchers found overall that increases in physical space per person
  did correspond to happier families. But what truly surprised them was how
  families perceived that physical space – the amount of space per person, and
   whether it felt too crowded or distant – had a much greater impact on their
    relationships.
